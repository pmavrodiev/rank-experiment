1. Hard to get a controlled environment in an online setting. People
are not focused on the game all the time, rather tend to get
distracted while waiting for the others (e.g. browse other stuff,
check emails, etc.). This causes delayed responses, which makes other
players, who need to wait long, frustrated.


2. From 1. we need a controlled environment - check Lab.

3. 5 stages and 10 rounds seems ok. We can do 4 sessions with 15-20
people in each sessions. In total that's 60-80 people. 

4. Check the system size effects. MZ correctly pointed out that with
fewer people, one is less confident in his guess, even for low
ranks. In essence, a person with rank 1 out of 6 will feel more unsure
that a person with rank 1 out of 20.

5. Automate the server a bit. In case all players have submitted an
estimate for a given round, start the next round automatically.
